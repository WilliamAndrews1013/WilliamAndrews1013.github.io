description: This game was made for my first assignment in my Game Design class. The goal was to create a FPS game where there were waves of enemy that would come at you until you die. We had to also have 2 different types of enemies but as for the rest we were free to do as we liked. I decided to build a map based out of the desert. This assignment got me a 100%. This was made in Unity
