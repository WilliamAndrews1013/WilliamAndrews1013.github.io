description: Plushie's Tower was a game made for the 2024 Sherbrooke Game Jam. The theme for this game jam was innocence, so we decided to make the game a charming puzzle game that captures the innocence of childhood. As a mischievous kid determined to sneak out for a daytime adventure instead of taking a nap, you must solve puzzles to escape your room. I was part of a 8 person team. My tasks for this game was to create the functionallity of one of the puzzles and I also partook in most of the level design and making sure the map felt like you were a child.
