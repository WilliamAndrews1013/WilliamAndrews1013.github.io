description: All White Night was my first ever game jam I had ever done. The theme for this game jam was "Nuit Blanche". In this game our vision was to build a game where you "survive" the night and escape the mansion you were at partying. During the eveneing you noticed people who were falling asleep were starting to disappear, so you find ways to stay awake and out of the darkness and escape. You can pick up empty beer cans to throw at the enemies to stun them and you have energy drinks and coffee to give you more energy. This project I was part of a team of 6 and we had 4 programmers. I mainly worked on the couch function where they drag you in and trap you and deplet your energy at a rapid rate. I also worked on level design and implementation. Just making sure everything had hitboxes and functioned as they should
