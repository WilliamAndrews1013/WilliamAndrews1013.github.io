description: This game was made as a final project for my game programming class in CEGEP. For this project we were put in teams of 3 and had to create a game. My team and I decided to go with a metroidvania style game but it is about a king trying to take back his castle. In this game you go through 3 levels all with different themes and you fight enemies to make it back to your kingdom. For this project I worked mostly on character movement, abilities and animations. I also worked on the first level (One showed in the video) as well as most of the HUD and UI. This game was made using Unity
