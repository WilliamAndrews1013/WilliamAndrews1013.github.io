description: This project was for a game jam where the theme was chain reaction. I was part of a team of 8 and 1 of 2 programmers. My tasks for this 48 hour game jam was player movement and making sure the co op worked properly. I also partook a lot in the game design process and solving the merge conflicts that arose throughout the game jam.
